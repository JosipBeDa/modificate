error[E0277]: the trait bound `Cow<'_, str>: From<&Vec<u8>>` is not satisfied

  |          ^^^^^^^^ the trait `From<&Vec<u8>>` is not implemented for `Cow<'_, str>`

  = help: the following other types implement trait `From<T>`:
            <Cow<'a, CStr> as From<&'a CStr>>
            <Cow<'a, CStr> as From<&'a CString>>
            <Cow<'a, CStr> as From<CString>>

            <Cow<'a, OsStr> as From<&'a OsString>>
            <Cow<'a, OsStr> as From<OsString>>
            <Cow<'a, Path> as From<&'a Path>>
            <Cow<'a, Path> as From<&'a PathBuf>>
          and $N others
  = note: required for `&Vec<u8>` to implement `Into<Cow<'_, str>>`

  = note: this error originates in the derive macro `Validate` (in Nightly builds, run with -Z macro-backtrace for more info)
